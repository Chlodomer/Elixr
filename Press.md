Hi, my name is Dr. Yaron Fuchs, and I'm the Chief Technology Officer and Founder of Elixr. I'm truly honored to be recognized as part of the Longevity 100 list, a community of people shaping how we understand and extend health plan. At Elixr, we're redefining the biology of aging through science-driven innovations in hair and skin regeneration. Our mission is simple, to give people choices they never had, To stay biologically younger, naturally, not just in appearance. By combining cutting-edge stem cell biology, molecular signaling, and novel biomimetic peptides, we aim to unlock the body's own regenerative power. To me, longevity isn't just about adding years. It's about restoring vitality, confidence, and the biology that keeps us feeling alive. I'm excited about the future of aging because for the first time, Science is empowering us to rejuvenate hair and skin at their source by reigniting the body's own regenerative potential. Thank you to INCOS, to this recognition, to everyone pushing the boundaries of longevity science, to a future where we don't just slow aging, we redefine it. 



Hi, my name is Dr. Yaron Fuchs and I'm the Chief Technology Officer and Founder of Prologue. At Prologue we're redefining how science and biotechnology can enhance the way we age, applying rigorous biology to advance hair and skin regeneration. We've developed breakthrough science that can block hair whitening and depending on what we catch it, can even reverse it. Like many great discoveries, our story began in a serendipitous manner. We were originally working on trying to develop novel regenerative medicine strategies. Then, one day, one of my students came back to the lab with unexpected results. I asked him, did the experiment work? He said, um, I'm not sure. All I can say is that the hairs on the skin we worked on turned white. That moment changed everything. We decided to dive deeper and uncover key aspects of the mechanism behind hair whitening. Inside every hair follicle lives a unique population of cells called melanocyte stem cells. These cells are crucial. They give rise to melanocyte, the pigment-producing cells that color our hair. When these cells are lost or stop functioning, the hair turns white. Building on that discovery, we created a powerful screening platform to identify compounds capable of protecting and rejuvenating these cells. Through several rounds of refinement and evolution, we engineered novel biomimetic peptides capable of penetrating the scalp and precisely targeting melanocyte stem cells and their daughter cells and melanocytes. We then developed advanced delivery technologies to ensure these peptide roots exactly where they're needed, safely, effectively, and consistently. Today, we're seeing remarkable results in human hair follicles and scalps, demonstrating that it's possible to block and potentially reverse hair whitening. But this is only the beginning. From melanocyte stem cells to hair follicle and epidermal regeneration, our goal is to harness the most advanced science in the world to redefine what's possible in biological innovation. Our mission is simple, to give people the choice to stay biologically younger, naturally, not just in appearance. Where advanced biology meets the art of delivery, renewal becomes reality and regeneration begins one hair at a time. Welcome to Prologue, the beginning of what's next.
